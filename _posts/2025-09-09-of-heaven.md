Of heaven, I am convinced that the humand mind has no dimension to fully appreciate what it will fell like. That is why even in our trials as Christians we still languish in grief, it is understandable. That is why there are some who still deny Christ.

Of heaven, it is a beauty that none of the human dimensions that exist in time are able to process.
