Of heaven, I am convinced that the human mind has no dimension to fully appreciate what it will feel like. That is why even in our trials as Christians we still languish in grief, it is understandable. That is why there are some who still deny Christ. We are just not able to fully understand the how it will feel.

Of heaven, it is a beauty that none of the human dimensions that exist in time are able to process.
