Bartimaeus offers a very forward prayer when he encounters Jesus that we should always follow this template in our most distressful circumstances. No lengthy contextualization, no praises, just straight to the point. This encounter as recalled by Luke in chapter 18 is as follows:

> "What do you want me to do for you?"<br><br>
> "Lord, let me receive my sight!"<br><br>
> "Receive your sight;&nbsp;your faith has made you well."

Immediately after this the man receives his sight. Let us never waste our words when in times of distressing needs and we come before the Lord. Just go straight to the point like son of Timaeus.
