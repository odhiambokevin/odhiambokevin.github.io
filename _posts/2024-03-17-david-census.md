Genesis explicitly exposes the subtle and scheming nature of satan. Discerning this trait of the enemy is so important for Christians that it is brought early in the text of the Bible. The subtle nature of the malignant cunning of Satan brings down man from the glory God had made him for. The deception establishes the kingdom of satan on earth that it takes the death and resurrection of Jesus to redeem man, and the earth from the forces of the devil. This is captured in *`John 12:31`*


> *<sup>31</sup>"Now is the judgement of this world,<br>
> now shall the ruler of this world be cast out."*

We see satan using deception to engage Eve by asking her whether God had asked them not to eat of *any* tree in the garden. The devil knows that the command was given for a specific tree, but alluding to a blanket inclusion of all trees, it allows him an opportunity to engage the woman in conversation. Eventually humanity falls. The subtleness is seen in the engagement between the enemy and Jesus when he attempts to tempt Jesus. Jesus is armed with the *`Sword of the Spirit`*, the *`Word`*, and successfully repulses the attempts.

It seems as though temptation from the enemy only comes when humanity is in favour with the Lord. When you encounter temptation, may you discern in your spirit that it is because you are in favour with God. However, temptation from the enemy at times takes a form that we may not immediately perceive to be sin. This is the point I wish to make with this post. An example is in the text of `1 Chronicles 21`. It is suggested to David by satan to number Israel. Although `2 Samuel 24` states that God himself incited David, from the experience of Job, we can conclude that it is indeed the devil, with permission from God, that incites David.

It is not conclusively agreed as to why the census was in itself a sin. It is believed that the victories in battle might have caused David to develop pride in his own army. The numbering is done specifically to the fighting men. David may have begun attributing his battlefield success to the strength of his army and not to the victorious hand of God. Again, drawing parallels from Job, we an only speculate on what the conversation between God and satan was wit regards to this thing.

The point to draw, and this is where you pay maximum attention, is that the subtle cunning of the enemy might come in such a way that we don\'t immediately perceive it. It may seek to draw in us feelings of pride or anger or any other ungodly passion. We may put faith in our abilities and not on the divine provision of God. May we pray for discernment to always perceive the more subtle temptations in our journey of faith. Amen.
