I was reading the Gospel of the disciple whom Jesus loved and could\'t help but notice that there was one burning question that the Pharisees really had about Jesus: Is this man the Messiah? All their probing, mental traps and scriptural gymnastics were purposefully designed to answer this one question. Interesting enough, to my joyous surprise, it seems Jesus deliberately gave them vague answers to purposefully keep them in a state of perpetual suspense. If you go through the exchanges between Jesus and the Pharisees, this ambiguity that Jesus the Christ plants in the hearts of the Pharisees is so plain to see it's amazing how we rarely discern it. But why does Jesus not answer them plainly?

I have a theory. The Pharisees were posed by the devil himself. Jesus explicitly asserts this in John 8:44 when he says:

> "You are of your father the devil..."

The bewilderment that plagues the Pharisees, lets call them the offspring of the devil, in Jesus' own words, which essentially makes them devils, is the same anguish and uncertainty the devil suffers when tempting Jesus. He is burning to know whether indeed this man is whom he says he is. He probes Jesus during the temptation by beginning the first two tests with

> "If you are the Son of God"

Jesus, just like with the Pharisees, does not do anything to explicitly convince the devil that he is indeed "the Son of God". The last test is a classic move by the deceiver. He cunningly and indirectly asks the same thing but this time tries to get Jesus to worship him. All responses Jesus gives imply the he could have been anyone, even an overzealous believer.

The reason for this vague display about his identity to the devil and his sons is because had they indeed known that He is Christ, they would have prevented his death, since it is by his death and resurrection, that the accuser is defeated unto eternity. By preventing the death of Jesus, man would have never been saved.

The word of a king is law that even the king cannot go against. This is why King Darius was much distressed when his law demanded that Daniel had to be cast in the den of lions. God's word, in Psalm 138:2, is exalted thus not even God can go against His word. For a King's decree to be revoked, he had to die and only a new King in place could make another decree.

It is for this purpose that God took the body of man and died on the cross to deliver man from the bondage of eternal death. His word had decreed that the "wages of sin is death" but with Christ risen, we get "the free gift of God" which is life eternal in Christ. God dies and now makes a new decree that "whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life".

It is for this reason that Jesus does not make himself known to the Pharisees clearly and they are left with no resort than to kill him. Caiaphas rents his clothes as in Mathew 26:65 and indiscernible to them, this is a sign that he is no longer purified as a high priest according to Leviticus 21:10. Unbeknown to him, by renting his clothes, Jesus becomes the High Priest.
