Acknowledging the Glory of God is a running theme in the Book of Psalms, as it is in the Bible in general. The last five chapters of Psalms are even more explicit on this need for creation to praise the Lord. Then as I was reading Psalms 148, reference is made to inanimate things such as the sun, moon, wind, fire among others praising the Lord. I have seen similar verses in the Bible before as in Psalms 19 where seemingly inanimate things praise God, even though they do not have speech (Psalms 19: 2-4). Then I asked myself, what exactly does it mean to praise the Lord?

Psalms 19:5-6 give a hint to the answer. However, what gave me discernment is verse 9 of Psalms 148 as I read it this morning. Especially the inclusion of fruit trees. If a fruit tree was to praise God, what would that look like? Is it not to bear fruit in abundance to manifest the Glory of him that created it? Is bearing fruit not the purpose of a fruit tree? Are not the elements in Psalms 148:8 fulfilling the commandment of God on their purpose of creation? The stormy wind to blow as hard as it can? The sun to ensure that nothing is hid from its heat (Psalms 19:5-6)?

To praise the Lord, for us men, then means to fulfill our God given purpose to its full capacity that when it manifests men can only look in awe at the light of God shinning in us. What makes it a bit more intricate for us men is that we first need to individually come to realization of our purpose to allow us to praise the Lord fully in our inherent calling. But since this pursuit can take long, we are then called to meanwhile praise him with singing and shouts, with horns and lyre. This is just to substitute our true ability to praise God as we wait to be brought into the revelation of our purpose.

Praise the Lord.
