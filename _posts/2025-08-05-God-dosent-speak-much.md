The Word of the King was law. Kings rule by decree not through physical strength. That is why when Darius was told that Daniel had broken the King\'s law. he laboured even until the sun went down trying to find a way around his law to save Daniel. Even Herod, who had earlier not been able to kill John the Baptist like he wanted initially, out of fear, is forced to behead John on the account of his words, not his will.

I presume, heavy emphasis on the presumption, that the reason God the father does not talk much is because of the significant effect his words might have on all creation, both unseen and seen. God is very careful (out of lack of a sufficient word) to not utter words. His mere words were used to spark creation. In fact I submit most physical encounters with God are mostly through Jesus Christ, both in the old and new testament. I also suspect the reason God cannot forgive satan is because God must have said something to the effect that satan\'s condemnation was final. This is just me in my own thoughts and I neither claim this to be biblical exposition. Though with the will of God, I hope to be given the grace to search out this matter theologically within the confines of human abilities.

That is why God cannot lie, in the strict sense of the word. If it were Tuesday today, for instance, and God said it is Monday, the effect of this is that it would in fact will become Monday. If it were raining and God said it is not raining, the rain would stop. That is what it means when we profess the truth that God cannot lie.

Part of the reason God kept quiet when Jesus asked him to remove the cup of suffering, was that God knew the implication his words would have at that moment. That is how much God loves us, that he gave up his only son. Even in instances where he could save him, he keeps quiet. Jesus even acknowledges that scriptures must be fulfilled that\'s why he restrains himself from seeking God\'s help in Mathew 26:53. This power of God\'s word is also acknowledged by satan when he tempts Jesus.

My interpretation of Exodus 32:10 was that it was predicated on Moses letting God alone to consume the people, as God says. But Moses did not let God alone and so God did not actually pronounce himself on the matter with finality. It was conditional on Moses letting him alone. It is for me the same case with Nineveh, whose salvation was dependent or conditional on whether they repented.
