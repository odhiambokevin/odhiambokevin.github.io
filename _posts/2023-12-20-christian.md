Deep inside I knew the kind of Christian I was aspiring to be. Unashamedly too. I didn\'t want to be the type that finds comfort in talking eloquently about the little truth that had been revealed to me from His word. The type that finds pleasure in the assumption that we do God a favour in preaching about Him. Obsessed with talking about God rather than talking to God. Marveling at the brilliance of delivering his message. No. That is not who I wanted to be.

My desire has always been to be the Mathew 13:44 type. Keeping Christ Jesus for myself; if that was at all possible. For won\'t He be manifest in my works? I didn\'t care whether others knew Jesus or not. As long as I could have Jesus all to myself, I would be contended. Whether this was a good thing or not, I never felt the particular desire or inclination to search out.
