In reading the Bible, one can almost touch the amount of pleasure and joy God felt when Jesus was baptized. The moment is so special to God that his Spirit descends on Jesus as a dove as an outward sign of approval just in case we doubted just how special Jesus is. A proud father.

But then we feel the same diametric feeling when Jesus' is almost about to give up his spirit. There are people who in their most deepest pain always wonder where God was. Where was God when my child died in hospital? Where was God when I suffered this loss? Where are you God when I am going through this? God is in the exact place he was when his son died
.

You can imagine the grief he must have felt when Jesus wondered why God had left him. I suspect the reason Jesus thought God had left him is because there were some details of his death that only God knew. That is why even the day of his return, even to the hour, only God knows. God would have wished to at least inform him of what is to happen in the immediate moments, for Jesus knew the main grand scheme of things, but God could only watch in painful silence.

In Jewish culture, people tear their clothes as a sign of intense mourning after a heavy loss of a loved one. And in tearing clothes, one can only tear it from top going down. Although in modern times the practice has been modernized. This intensity of loss is seen when God tears his thick covering in the Holy of Holies in two, from top to bottom. We can only imagine the amount of pain he felt. Oh how we break God's heart.
